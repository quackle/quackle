Requirements:
-------------

1. Xcode 9 or above (for the compiler and build tools)
2. A version of Qt 5.  I use HomeBrew to grab the latest version,
   presently Qt 5.13.0. Installing in HomeBrew is as easy as
		brew install qt

Building Quackle:
-----------------

Clone the repo.  Use qmake to build quackle.pro and quackleio/quackleio.pro:

	qmake quackle.pro && make
	cd quackleio && qmake && make && cd ..

Then make an Xcode project for quacker using qmake.

	cd quacker && qmake -spec macx-xcode && cd ..

You can now open the project in Xcode, build and run as usual.


Creating the DMG:
---------------------------------
* Set up Xcode with your Mac Developer account, and make sure you
  have a Developer ID Application signing certificate installed into
  your Keychain.
* In the Xcode settings, set the deployment target to 10.9 (earlier versions
  don't appear to work with C++11).
* Create an Archive build using XCode.
* From the Archive interface, click Validate... and validate for a Developer
  ID-signed Application.  If you have a signing profile, this validation
  should work.
* Click Export... and export as a Mac Application.
* You now have an unsigned application which is missing Qt frameworks, but
  will work locally.
* From the Qt4 distribution, run 'macdeployqt Quackle.app'.
* But, it turns out that the Frameworks installed by macdeployqt are partly
  broken and can't be code-signed.  So, remove the Frameworks directory, clone
  	https://github.com/jfultz/MacQt4Frameworks.git
  and cp -R the entire Frameworks directory into Quackle.app/Contents.
* Run 'codesign -s <identity> --force --deep Quackle.app' where <identity>
  is the SHA1 of your certificate (if you open it in Keychain and scroll all
  the way to the bottom, you'l see it...but you'll have to strip the spaces).
* Verify code-signing with
	spctl --assess --type execute --verbose Quackle.app
* Package it up in a .dmg.  I used the *very* nice package create-dmg off of
  Github with the following command-line:

create-dmg --app-drop-link 400 100 --icon Quackle.app 100 100 \
--window-size 500 250 --background DmgBackground.png Quackle.dmg Quackle.app
